# FAQ

### Why are only the Oxford Dictionary of English and the Oxford American Writer’s Thesaurus supported?

macOS dictionaries are packaged in an awkward format that isn’t trivial to parse, and each dictionary defines their own layout and structure. Figuring out the best method to convert them was a laborious task, so I spent my time optimising the output for the dictionaries I use the most.

### How do I report an issue?

Accurate and thorough information is crucial for a proper diagnosis. **At a minimum, your report should include:**

* The [debugger](https://www.alfredapp.com/help/workflows/advanced/debugger/) output of the failing action.
* Your installed versions of: the Workflow, Alfred, and macOS. *Be precise, don’t say “latest”.*
